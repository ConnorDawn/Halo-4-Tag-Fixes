These are instructions you can follow yourself to fix your Ragnarök bugs.

<----- Yellow Sky Void ----->

Navigate to "zone sets" in your z11_valhalla.scenario tag, and locate "Sky clear Colour" change it from (1,1,0) to (0.002428216, 0.002428216, 0)


// DAWNS NOTE: Although this "fixes" the bug, it is only a dirty fix, as it is caused by the colour in the "sky clear colour" field being handled weirdly on MCC vs Legacy. If you clamp the colour on Legacy, you get the same bug/result as MCC.
